# 🎵 MusicX Landing Page 

This is a music landing page clone built using only **HTML and CSS** — designed as part of my frontend learning journey to practice modern layouts, Flexbox, and styling.
This landing page project is inspired by the design of Spotify, created purely for educational and personal learning purposes. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Spotify.
